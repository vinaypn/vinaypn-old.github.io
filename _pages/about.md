I am currently a faculty member in the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.bath.ac.uk/departments/department-of-computer-science/) in the [University of Bath](https://www.bath.ac.uk/). Previously I have worked at the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at IIT Kanpur, Bell Labs Antwerp, been a Postdoctoral Fellow in KU Leuven with [Prof. Luc Van Gool](https://ee.ethz.ch/the-department/faculty/professors/person-detail.OTAyMzM=.TGlzdC80MTEsMTA1ODA0MjU5.html) and obtained a Ph.D. while being guided by [Prof. Subhasis Chaudhuri](https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/~sc/).

I am interested in research in Computer Vision and Machine Learning. I am specifically interested in the following areas of research: 
* Visual Recognition with Scarce Supervision
* Multi-modal Deep Learning
* Explainable AI
* Adversarial and Probabilistic Deep Learning

I am currently an Associate Professor in the [Department of Computer Science and Engineering](http://www.cse.iitk.ac.in) in the [Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur](http://www.iitk.ac.in). Previously I have worked at Bell Labs Antwerp, been a Postdoctoral Fellow in KU Leuven with [Prof. Luc Van Gool](https://ee.ethz.ch/the-department/faculty/professors/person-detail.OTAyMzM=.TGlzdC80MTEsMTA1ODA0MjU5.html) and obtained a Ph.D. while being guided by [Prof. Subhasis Chaudhuri](https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/~sc/).

I am interested in research in Computer Vision and Machine Learning. I am specifically interested in the following areas of research: 
* Visual Recognition with Scarce Supervision
* Multi-modal Deep Learning
* Explainable AI
* Adversarial and Probabilistic Deep Learning

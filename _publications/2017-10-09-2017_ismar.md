excerpt: 'The feeling of presence in virtual reality has enabled a large number of applications. These applications typically deal with 360° content. However, a large amount of existing content is available in terms of images and videos i.e 2D content. Unfortunately, these do not react to the viewer&apos;s position or motion when viewed through a VR HMD. Thus in this work, we propose reactive displays for VR which instigate a feeling of discovery while exploring 2D content. We create this by taking into account user&apos;s position and motion to compute homography based mappings that adapt the 2D content and re-project it onto the display. This allows the viewer to obtain a more richer experience of interacting with 2D content similar to the effect of viewing through the window at a scene. We also provide a VR interface that uses a constrained set of reactive displays to easily browse through 360° content. The proposed interface tackles the problem of nausea caused by existing interfaces like photospheres by providing a natural room-like intermediate interface before changing 360° content. We perform user studies to evaluate both of our interfaces. The results show that the proposed reactive display interfaces are indeed beneficial.'

The feeling of presence in virtual reality has enabled a large number of applications. These applications typically deal with 360° content. However, a large amount of existing content is available in terms of images and videos i.e 2D content. Unfortunately, these do not react to the viewer&apos;s position or motion when viewed through a VR HMD. Thus in this work, we propose reactive displays for VR which instigate a feeling of discovery while exploring 2D content. We create this by taking into account user&apos;s position and motion to compute homography based mappings that adapt the 2D content and re-project it onto the display. This allows the viewer to obtain a more richer experience of interacting with 2D content similar to the effect of viewing through the window at a scene. We also provide a VR interface that uses a constrained set of reactive displays to easily browse through 360° content. The proposed interface tackles the problem of nausea caused by existing interfaces like photospheres by providing a natural room-like intermediate interface before changing 360° content. We perform user studies to evaluate both of our interfaces. The results show that the proposed reactive display interfaces are indeed beneficial.

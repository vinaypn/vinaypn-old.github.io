excerpt: 'Understanding videos of people speaking across international borders is hard as audiences from different demographies do not understand the language. Such speech videos are often supplemented with language subtitles. However, these hamper the viewing experience as the attention is shared. Simple audio dubbing in a different language makes the video appear unnatural due to unsynchronized lip motion. In this paper, we propose a system for automated cross-language lip synchronization for re-dubbed videos. Our model generates superior photorealistic lip-synchronization over original video in comparison to the current re-dubbing method. With the help of a user-based study, we verify that our method is preferred over unsynchronized videos.'

Understanding videos of people speaking across international borders is hard as audiences from different demographies do not understand the language. Such speech videos are often supplemented with language subtitles. However, these hamper the viewing experience as the attention is shared. Simple audio dubbing in a different language makes the video appear unnatural due to unsynchronized lip motion. In this paper, we propose a system for automated cross-language lip synchronization for re-dubbed videos. Our model generates superior photorealistic lip-synchronization over original video in comparison to the current re-dubbing method. With the help of a user-based study, we verify that our method is preferred over unsynchronized videos.

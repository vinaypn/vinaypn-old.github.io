excerpt: 'Convolutional layers are a major driving force behind the successes of deep learning. Pointwise convolution (PWC) is a 1 × 1 convolutional filter that is primarily used for parameter reduction. However, the PWC ignores the spatial information around the points it is processing. This design is by choice, in order to reduce the overall parameters and computations. However, we hypothesize that this shortcoming of PWC has a significant impact on the network performance. We propose an alternative design for pointwise convolution, which uses spatial information from the input efficiently. Our design significantly improves the performance of the networks without substantially increasing the number of parameters and computations. We experimentally show that our design results in significant improvement in the performance of the network for classification as well as detection.'

Convolutional layers are a major driving force behind the successes of deep learning. Pointwise convolution (PWC) is a 1 × 1 convolutional filter that is primarily used for parameter reduction. However, the PWC ignores the spatial information around the points it is processing. This design is by choice, in order to reduce the overall parameters and computations. However, we hypothesize that this shortcoming of PWC has a significant impact on the network performance. We propose an alternative design for pointwise convolution, which uses spatial information from the input efficiently. Our design significantly improves the performance of the networks without substantially increasing the number of parameters and computations. We experimentally show that our design results in significant improvement in the performance of the network for classification as well as detection.

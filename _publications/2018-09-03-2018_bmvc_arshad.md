excerpt: 'In the general settings of supervised learning, human action recognition has been a widely studied topic. The classifiers learned in this setting assume that the training and test data have been sampled from the same underlying probability distribution. However, in most of the practical scenarios, this assumption is not true, resulting in a suboptimal performance of the classifiers. This problem, referred to as Domain Shift, has been extensively studied, but mostly for image/object classification task. In this paper, we investigate the problem of Domain Shift in action videos, an area that has remained under-explored, and propose two new approaches named Action Modeling on Latent Subspace (AMLS) and Deep Adversarial Action Adaptation (DAAA). In the AMLS approach, the action videos in the target domain are modeled as a sequence of points on a latent subspace and adaptive kernels are successively learned between the source domain point and the sequence of target domain points on the manifold. In the DAAA approach, an end-to-end adversarial learning framework is proposed to align the two domains. The action adaptation experiments were conducted using various combinations of multi-domain action datasets, including six common classes of Olympic Sports and UCF50 datasets and all classes of KTH, MSR and our own SonyCam datasets. In this paper, we have achieved consistent improvements over chosen baselines and obtained some state-of-the-art results for the datasets.'

In the general settings of supervised learning, human action recognition has been a widely studied topic. The classifiers learned in this setting assume that the training and test data have been sampled from the same underlying probability distribution. However, in most of the practical scenarios, this assumption is not true, resulting in a suboptimal performance of the classifiers. This problem, referred to as Domain Shift, has been extensively studied, but mostly for image/object classification task. In this paper, we investigate the problem of Domain Shift in action videos, an area that has remained under-explored, and propose two new approaches named Action Modeling on Latent Subspace (AMLS) and Deep Adversarial Action Adaptation (DAAA). In the AMLS approach, the action videos in the target domain are modeled as a sequence of points on a latent subspace and adaptive kernels are successively learned between the source domain point and the sequence of target domain points on the manifold. In the DAAA approach, an end-to-end adversarial learning framework is proposed to align the two domains. The action adaptation experiments were conducted using various combinations of multi-domain action datasets, including six common classes of Olympic Sports and UCF50 datasets and all classes of KTH, MSR and our own SonyCam datasets. In this paper, we have achieved consistent improvements over chosen baselines and obtained some state-of-the-art results for the datasets.

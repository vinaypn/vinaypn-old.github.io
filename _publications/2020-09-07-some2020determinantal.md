excerpt: 'We present a determinantal point process (DPP) inspired alternative to non-maximumsuppression (NMS) which has become an integral step in all state-of-the-art object de-tection frameworks.  DPPs have been shown to encourage diversity in subset selectionproblems. We pose NMS as a subset selection problem and posit that directly incor-porating DPP like framework can improve the overall performance of the object detectionsystem.  We propose an optimization problem which takes the same inputs as NMS, butintroduces a novel sub-modularity based diverse subset selection functional. Our resultsstrongly indicate that the modifications proposed in this paper can provide consistentimprovements to state-of-the-art object detection pipelines.'

We present a determinantal point process (DPP) inspired alternative to non-maximumsuppression (NMS) which has become an integral step in all state-of-the-art object de-tection frameworks.  DPPs have been shown to encourage diversity in subset selectionproblems. We pose NMS as a subset selection problem and posit that directly incor-porating DPP like framework can improve the overall performance of the object detectionsystem.  We propose an optimization problem which takes the same inputs as NMS, butintroduces a novel sub-modularity based diverse subset selection functional. Our resultsstrongly indicate that the modifications proposed in this paper can provide consistentimprovements to state-of-the-art object detection pipelines.

2007-10-19	Image Restoration using Geometrically Stabilized Reverse Heat Equation	IEEE International Conference on Image Processing (ICIP)	"Blind restoration of blurred images is a classical ill-posed problem. There has been considerable interest in the use of partial differential equations to solve this problem. The blurring of an image has traditionally been modeled by Witkin [10] and Koenderink [4] by the heat equation. This has been the basis of the Gaussian scale space. However, a similar theoretical formulation has not been possible for deblurring of images due to the ill-posed nature of the reverse heat equation. Here we consider the stabilization of the reverse heat equation. We do this by damping the distortion along the edges by adding a normal component of the heat equation in the forward direction. We use a stopping criterion based on the divergence of the curvature in the resulting reverse heat flow. The resulting stabilized reverse heat flow makes it possible to solve the challenging problem of blind space varying deconvolution. The method is justified by a varied set of experimental results."

2007-09-10	Shape Recovery Using Stochastic Heat Flow	British Machine Vision Conference (BMVC)	"We consider the problem of depth estimation from multiple images based on the defocus cue. For a Gaussian defocus blur, the observations can be shown to be the solution of a deterministic but inhomogeneous diffusion process. However, the diffusion process does not sufficiently address the case in which the Gaussian kernel is deformed. This deformation happens due to several factors like self-occlusion, possible aberrations and imperfections in the aperture. These issues can be solved by incorporating a stochastic perturbation into the heat diffusion process. The resultant flow is that of an inhomogeneous heat diffusion perturbed by a stochastic curvature driven motion. The depth in the scene is estimated from the coefficient of the stochastic heat equation without actually knowing the departure from the Gaussian assumption. Further, the proposed method also takes into account the non-convex nature of the diffusion process. The method provides a strong theoretical framework for handling the depth from defocus problem."

2007-02-01	"On defocus, diffusion and depth estimation"	Pattern Recognition Letters	"An intrinsic property of real aperture imaging has been that the observations tend to be defocused. This artifact has been used in an innovative manner by researchers for depth estimation, since the amount of defocus varies with varying depth in the scene. There have been various methods to model the defocus blur. We model the defocus process using the model of diffusion of heat. The diffusion process has been traditionally used in low level vision problems like smoothing, segmentation and edge detection. In this paper a novel application of the diffusion principle is made for generating the defocus space of the scene. The defocus space is the set of all possible observations for a given scene that can be captured using a physical lens system. Using the notion of defocus space we estimate the depth in the scene and also generate the corresponding fully focused equivalent pin-hole image. The algorithm described here also brings out the equivalence of the two modalities, viz. depth from focus and depth from defocus for structure recovery."	"V.P. Namboodiri and S.

2007-01-01	Retrieval of images of man-made structures based on projective invariance	Pattern Recognition Journal	"In this paper we propose a geometry-based image retrieval scheme that makes use of projectively invariant features. Cross-ratio (CR) is an invariant feature under projective transformations for collinear points. We compute the CRs of point sets in quadruplets and the CR histogram is used as the feature for retrieval purposes. Being a geometric feature, it allows us to retrieve similar images irrespective of view point and illumination changes. We can retrieve the same building even if the facade has undergone a fresh coat of paints! Color and textural features can also be included, if desired. Experimental results show a favorably very good retrieval accuracy when tested on an image database of size 4000. The method is very effective in retrieving images having man-made objects rich in polygonal structures like buildings, rail tracks, etc."	"Rajashekhar, S. Chaudhuri and V.P.

2006-12-13	Improved Kernel-Based Object Tracking Under Occluded Scenarios	"Fifth Indian Conference on Computer Vision, Graphics & Image Processing"	"A successful approach for object tracking has been kernel based object tracking [1] by Comaniciu et al.. The method provides an effective solution to the problems of representation and localization in tracking. The method involves representation of an object by a feature histogram with an isotropic kernel and performing a gradient based mean shift optimization for localizing the kernel. Though robust, this technique fails under cases of occlusion. We improve the kernel based object tracking by performing the localization using a generalized (bidirectional) mean shift based optimization. This makes the method resilient to occlusions. Another aspect related to the localization step is handling of scale changes by varying the bandwidth of the kernel. Here, we suggest a technique based on SIFT features [2] by Lowe to enable change of bandwidth of the kernel even in the presence of occlusion. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the techniques proposed through extensive experimentation on a number of challenging data sets."	"V.P. Namboodiri, A. Ghorawat and S.

2005-07-25	Shock Filters based on Implicit Cluster Separation	IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR)	One of the classic problems in low level vision is image restoration. An important contribution toward this effort has been the development of shock filters by Osher and Rudin (1990). It performs image deblurring using hyperbolic partial differential equations. In this paper we relate the notion of cluster separation from the field of pattern recognition to the shock filter formulation. A kind of shock filter is proposed based on the idea of gradient based separation of clusters. The proposed formulation is general enough as it can allow various models of density functions in the cluster separation process. The efficacy of the method is demonstrated through various examples.

Most common applications of diffusion have been in low level vision problems like segmentation and edge detection. In this paper a novel application of the linear diffusion principle is made for the estimation of depth using the properties of the real aperture imaging system.

2004-10-01	Image retrieval based on projective invariance	IEEE International Conference on Image Processing (ICIP)	"We propose an image retrieval scheme based on projectively invariant features. Since cross-ratio is the fundamental invariant feature under projective transformations for points, we use that as the basic feature parameter. We compute the cross-ratios of point sets in quadruplets and a discrete representation of the distribution of the cross-ratio is obtained from the computed values. The distribution is used as the feature for retrieval purposes. The method is very effective in retrieving images, like buildings, having similar planar 3D structures."	"Rajashekhar, S.

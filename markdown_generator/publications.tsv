2013-01-15	Nonuniform Image Patch Exemplars for Low Level Vision	IEEE Workshop on Applications of Computer Vision (WACV)	"In this paper we propose the use of nonuniformly resized image patch exemplars for solving low level vision problems like denoising and super-resolution. While patch-based methods have been shown to be successful for several such applications, these methods have so far assumed uniform sizes for image patches. In this paper we address this restriction. We use an integral image representation for efficient computation of the matching cost for variable-sized patches. We show that nonuniform image patch exemplars are useful in improving classic techniques for nonlocal means-based denoising and example-based superresolution. We provide refinement cues to further improve the patch size estimation. This method can be adopted for a large number of related methods and applications due to its simplicity and generality."	"V.

2012-08-28	"Classification with Global, Local and Shared Features"	Joint DAGM (German Association for Pattern Recognition) and OAGM Symposium	"We present a framework that jointly learns and then uses multiple image windows for improved classification. Apart from using the entire image content as context, class-specific windows are added, as well as windows that target class pairs. The location and extent of the windows are set automatically by handling the window parameters as latent variables. This framework makes the following contributions: a) the addition of localized information through the class-specific windows improves classification, b) windows introduced for the classification of class pairs further improve the results, c) the windows and classification parameters can be effectively learnt using a discriminative max-margin approach with latent variables, and d) the same framework is suited for multiple visual tasks such as classifying objects, scenes and actions. Experiments demonstrate the aforementioned claims."	"Bilen H., Namboodiri V.P., Van Gool L.J. (2012) Classification with Global, Local and Shared Features. In: Pinz A., Pock T., Bischof H., Leberl F.

2011-11-06	Systematic evaluation of super-resolution using classification	 Visual Communications and Image Processing (VCIP)	"Currently two evaluation methods of super-resolution (SR) techniques prevail: The objective Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR) and a qualitative measure based on manual visual inspection. Both of these methods are sub-optimal: The latter does not scale well to large numbers of images, while the former does not necessarily reflect the perceived visual quality. We address these issues in this paper and propose an evaluation method based on image classification. We show that perceptual image quality measures like structural similarity are not suitable for evaluation of SR methods. On the other hand a systematic evaluation using large datasets of thousands of real-world images provides a consistent comparison of SR algorithms that corresponds to perceived visual quality. We verify the success of our approach by presenting an evaluation of three recent super-resolution algorithms on standard image classification datasets."	"V. De Smet, V.P. Namboodiri and L.

2011-09-02	Object and Action Classification with Latent Variables	British Machine Vision Conference	In this paper we propose a generic framework to incorporate unobserved auxiliary information for classifying objects and actions. This framework allows us to explicitly account for localisation and alignment of representations for generic object and action classes as latent variables. We approach this problem in the discriminative setting as learning a max-margin classifier that infers the class label along with the latent variables. Through this paper we make the following contributions a) We provide a method for incorporating latent variables into object and action classification b) We specifically account for the presence of an explicit class related subregion which can include foreground and/or background. c) We explore a way to learn a better classifier by iterative expansion of the latent parameter space. We demonstrate the performance of our approach by rigorous experimental evaluation on a number of standard object and action recognition datasets. <br> <b> Awarded: Best Paper Prize </b>	"H.

2011-09-22	Super-resolution techniques for minimally invasive surgery	MICCAI workshop on augmented environments for computer assisted interventions-AE-CAI	"We propose the use of super-resolution techniques to aid visualization while carrying out minimally invasive surgical procedures. These procedures are performed using small endoscopic cameras, which inherently have limited imaging resolution. The use of higher-end cam- eras is technologically challenging and currently not yet cost effective. A promising alternative is to consider improving the resolution by post- processing the acquired images through the use of currently prevalent super-resolution techniques. In this paper we analyse the different method- ologies that have been proposed for super-resolution and provide a comprehensive evaluation of the most significant algorithms. The methods are evaluated using challenging in-vivo real world medical datasets. We suggest that the use of a learning-based super-resolution algorithm com- bined with an edge-directed approach would be most suited for this application. "	"V. De Smet, V.P. Namboodiri and L.

2011-01-05	Action Recognition: A Region Based Approach	 IEEE Workshop on Applications of Computer Vision (WACV)	"We address the problem of recognizing actions in reallife videos. Space-time interest point-based approaches have been widely prevalent towards solving this problem. In contrast, more spatially extended features such as regions have not been so popular. The reason is, any local region based approach requires the motion flow information for a specific region to be collated temporally. This is challenging as the local regions are deformable and not well delineated from the surroundings. In this paper we address this issue by using robust tracking of regions and we show that it is possible to obtain region descriptors for classification of actions. This paper lays the groundwork for further investigation into region based approaches. Through this paper we make the following contributions a) We advocate identification of salient regions based on motion segmentation b) We adopt a state-of-the art tracker for robust tracking of the identified regions rather than using isolated space-time blocks c) We propose optical flow based region descriptors to encode the extracted trajectories in piece-wise blocks. We demonstrate the performance of our system on real-world data sets."	"H. Bilen, V.P. Namboodiri and L.

2008-10-12	Regularized depth from defocus	IEEE International Conference on Image Processing (ICIP)	"n the area of depth estimation from images an interesting approach has been structure recovery from defocus cue. Towards this end, there have been a number of approaches [4,6]. Here we propose a technique to estimate the regularized depth from defocus using diffusion. The coefficient of the diffusion equation is modeled using a pair-wise Markov random field (MRF) ensuring spatial regularization to enhance the robustness of the depth estimated. This framework is solved efficiently using a graph-cuts based techniques. The MRF representation is enhanced by incorporating a smoothness prior that is obtained from a graph based segmentation of the input images. The method is demonstrated on a number of data sets and its performance is compared with state of the art techniques."	"V.P. Namboodiri, S. Chaudhuri and S.

2008-06-23	Recovery of relative depth from a single observation using an uncalibrated (real-aperture) camera	IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR)	"In this paper we investigate the challenging problem of recovering the depth layers in a scene from a single defocused observation. The problem is definitely solvable if there are multiple observations. In this paper we show that one can perceive the depth in the scene even from a single observation. We use the inhomogeneous reverse heat equation to obtain an estimate of the blur, thereby preserving the depth information characterized by the defocus. However, the reverse heat equation, due to its parabolic nature, is divergent. We stabilize the reverse heat equation by considering the gradient degeneration as an effective stopping criterion. The amount of (inverse) diffusion is actually a measure of relative depth. Because of ill-posedness we propose a graph-cuts based method for inferring the depth in the scene using the amount of diffusion as a data likelihood and a smoothness condition on the depth in the scene. The method is verified experimentally on a varied set of test cases."	"V.P. Namboodiri and S. Chaudhuri  (2008).

2007-10-19	Image Restoration using Geometrically Stabilized Reverse Heat Equation	IEEE International Conference on Image Processing (ICIP)	"Blind restoration of blurred images is a classical ill-posed problem. There has been considerable interest in the use of partial differential equations to solve this problem. The blurring of an image has traditionally been modeled by Witkin [10] and Koenderink [4] by the heat equation. This has been the basis of the Gaussian scale space. However, a similar theoretical formulation has not been possible for deblurring of images due to the ill-posed nature of the reverse heat equation. Here we consider the stabilization of the reverse heat equation. We do this by damping the distortion along the edges by adding a normal component of the heat equation in the forward direction. We use a stopping criterion based on the divergence of the curvature in the resulting reverse heat flow. The resulting stabilized reverse heat flow makes it possible to solve the challenging problem of blind space varying deconvolution. The method is justified by a varied set of experimental results."

2007-09-10	Shape Recovery Using Stochastic Heat Flow	British Machine Vision Conference (BMVC)	"We consider the problem of depth estimation from multiple images based on the defocus cue. For a Gaussian defocus blur, the observations can be shown to be the solution of a deterministic but inhomogeneous diffusion process. However, the diffusion process does not sufficiently address the case in which the Gaussian kernel is deformed. This deformation happens due to several factors like self-occlusion, possible aberrations and imperfections in the aperture. These issues can be solved by incorporating a stochastic perturbation into the heat diffusion process. The resultant flow is that of an inhomogeneous heat diffusion perturbed by a stochastic curvature driven motion. The depth in the scene is estimated from the coefficient of the stochastic heat equation without actually knowing the departure from the Gaussian assumption. Further, the proposed method also takes into account the non-convex nature of the diffusion process. The method provides a strong theoretical framework for handling the depth from defocus problem."

2007-05-30	Super-Resolution Using Sub-band Constrained Total Variation	International Conference on Scale Space and Variational Methods in Computer Vision (SSVM)	"Super-resolution of a single image is a severely ill-posed problem in computer vision. It is possible to consider solving this problem by considering a total variation based regularization framework. The choice of total variation based regularization helps in formulating an edge preserving scheme for super-resolution. However, this scheme tends to result in a piece-wise constant resultant image. To address this issue, we extend the formulation by incorporating an appropriate sub-band constraint which ensures the preservation of textural details in trade off with noise present in the observation. The proposed framework is extensively evaluated and the experimental results for the same are presented"	" P. Chatterjee,  V.P. Namboodiri, S.

2007-02-01	"On defocus, diffusion and depth estimation"	Pattern Recognition Letters	"An intrinsic property of real aperture imaging has been that the observations tend to be defocused. This artifact has been used in an innovative manner by researchers for depth estimation, since the amount of defocus varies with varying depth in the scene. There have been various methods to model the defocus blur. We model the defocus process using the model of diffusion of heat. The diffusion process has been traditionally used in low level vision problems like smoothing, segmentation and edge detection. In this paper a novel application of the diffusion principle is made for generating the defocus space of the scene. The defocus space is the set of all possible observations for a given scene that can be captured using a physical lens system. Using the notion of defocus space we estimate the depth in the scene and also generate the corresponding fully focused equivalent pin-hole image. The algorithm described here also brings out the equivalence of the two modalities, viz. depth from focus and depth from defocus for structure recovery."	"V.P. Namboodiri and S.

2007-01-01	Retrieval of images of man-made structures based on projective invariance	Pattern Recognition Journal	"In this paper we propose a geometry-based image retrieval scheme that makes use of projectively invariant features. Cross-ratio (CR) is an invariant feature under projective transformations for collinear points. We compute the CRs of point sets in quadruplets and the CR histogram is used as the feature for retrieval purposes. Being a geometric feature, it allows us to retrieve similar images irrespective of view point and illumination changes. We can retrieve the same building even if the facade has undergone a fresh coat of paints! Color and textural features can also be included, if desired. Experimental results show a favorably very good retrieval accuracy when tested on an image database of size 4000. The method is very effective in retrieving images having man-made objects rich in polygonal structures like buildings, rail tracks, etc."	"Rajashekhar, S. Chaudhuri and V.P.

2006-12-13	Improved Kernel-Based Object Tracking Under Occluded Scenarios	"Fifth Indian Conference on Computer Vision, Graphics & Image Processing"	"A successful approach for object tracking has been kernel based object tracking [1] by Comaniciu et al.. The method provides an effective solution to the problems of representation and localization in tracking. The method involves representation of an object by a feature histogram with an isotropic kernel and performing a gradient based mean shift optimization for localizing the kernel. Though robust, this technique fails under cases of occlusion. We improve the kernel based object tracking by performing the localization using a generalized (bidirectional) mean shift based optimization. This makes the method resilient to occlusions. Another aspect related to the localization step is handling of scale changes by varying the bandwidth of the kernel. Here, we suggest a technique based on SIFT features [2] by Lowe to enable change of bandwidth of the kernel even in the presence of occlusion. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the techniques proposed through extensive experimentation on a number of challenging data sets."	"V.P. Namboodiri, A. Ghorawat and S.

2005-06-20	Shock Filters based on Implicit Cluster Separation	IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR)	One of the classic problems in low level vision is image restoration. An important contribution toward this effort has been the development of shock filters by Osher and Rudin (1990). It performs image deblurring using hyperbolic partial differential equations. In this paper we relate the notion of cluster separation from the field of pattern recognition to the shock filter formulation. A kind of shock filter is proposed based on the idea of gradient based separation of clusters. The proposed formulation is general enough as it can allow various models of density functions in the cluster separation process. The efficacy of the method is demonstrated through various examples.

2006-12-13	Improved Kernel-Based Object Tracking Under Occluded Scenarios	"F Indian Conference on Computer Vision, Graphics & Image Processing"	"A successful approach for object tracking has been kernel based object tracking [1] by Comaniciu et al.. The method provides an effective solution to the problems of representation and localization in tracking. The method involves representation of an object by a feature histogram with an isotropic kernel and performing a gradient based mean shift optimization for localizing the kernel. Though robust, this technique fails under cases of occlusion. We improve the kernel based object tracking by performing the localization using a generalized (bidirectional) mean shift based optimization. This makes the method resilient to occlusions. Another aspect related to the localization step is handling of scale changes by varying the bandwidth of the kernel. Here, we suggest a technique based on SIFT features [2] by Lowe to enable change of bandwidth of the kernel even in the presence of occlusion. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the techniques proposed through extensive experimentation on a number of challenging data sets."	"V.P. Namboodiri, A. Ghorawat and S.

2005-07-25	Shock Filters based on Implicit Cluster Separation	IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR)	One of the classic problems in low level vision is image restoration. An important contribution toward this effort has been the development of shock filters by Osher and Rudin (1990). It performs image deblurring using hyperbolic partial differential equations. In this paper we relate the notion of cluster separation from the field of pattern recognition to the shock filter formulation. A kind of shock filter is proposed based on the idea of gradient based separation of clusters. The proposed formulation is general enough as it can allow various models of density functions in the cluster separation process. The efficacy of the method is demonstrated through various examples.

2004-12-16	Use of Linear Diffusion in depth estimation based on defocus cue	"Fourth Indian Conference on Computer Vision, Graphics & Image Processing"	"Diffusion has been used extensively in computer vision. Most common applications of diffusion have been in low level vision problems like segmentation and edge detection. In this paper a novel application of the linear diffusion principle is made for the estimation of depth using the properties of the real aperture imaging system. The method uses two defocused images of a scene and the lens parameter setting as input and estimates the depth in the scene, and also generates the corresponding fully focused equivalent pin-hole image. The algorithm described here also brings out the equivalence of the two modalities, viz. depth from focus and depth from defocus for structure recovery."	"V.P. Namboodiri and S.

2004-10-01	Image retrieval based on projective invariance	IEEE International Conference on Image Processing (ICIP)	"We propose an image retrieval scheme based on projectively invariant features. Since cross-ratio is the fundamental invariant feature under projective transformations for points, we use that as the basic feature parameter. We compute the cross-ratios of point sets in quadruplets and a discrete representation of the distribution of the cross-ratio is obtained from the computed values. The distribution is used as the feature for retrieval purposes. The method is very effective in retrieving images, like buildings, having similar planar 3D structures."	"Rajashekhar, S.

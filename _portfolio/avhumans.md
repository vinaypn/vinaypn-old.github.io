## Audio-Visual Digital Humans

We have been pursuing research on a number of aspects related to audio-visual digital humans. On this page we present the works that we have been involved with

### Wav2Lip: Accurately Lip-syncing Videos In The Wild
In this work, we investigate the problem of lip-syncing a talking face video of an arbitrary identity to match a target speech segment. Current works excel at producing accurate lip movements on a static image or on videos of specific people seen during the training phase. However, they fail to accurately morph the actual lip movements of arbitrary identities in dynamic, unconstrained talking face videos, resulting in significant parts of the video being out-of-sync with the newly chosen audio. We identify key reasons pertaining to this and hence resolve them by learning from a powerful lip-sync discriminator. Next, we propose new, rigorous evaluation benchmarks and metrics to specifically measure the accuracy of lip synchronization in unconstrained videos. Extensive quantitative and human evaluations on our challenging benchmarks show that the lip-sync accuracy of the videos generated using our Wav2Lip model is almost as good as real synced videos. We clearly demonstrate the substantial impact of our Wav2Lip model in our publicly available demo video. We also open-source our code, models, and evaluation benchmarks to promote future research efforts in this space.
